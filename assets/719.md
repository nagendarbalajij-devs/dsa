### Problem
[K-th smallest pair](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/description/)

### Question
The distance of a pair of integers a and b is defined as the absolute difference between a and b.

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth smallest distance among all the pairs nums[i] and nums[j] where 0 <= i < j < nums.length.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,6,1], k = 3
Output: 5

### Approach
Considering this being a steam, we sort the inital values first. Then only consider k smallest terms as we wont be needing the others.

While processing new elements, if its larger than the kth smallest we disreagrd and use the current k-th value

If smaller then do a binary insert and return the new value.

Same can be appraoched with heap sort to the minimum k-th value

Very non elegant long approach, should be improved using heap sort, this was an experiment on binary insert which was not very effective
