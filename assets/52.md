[N-Queens II](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens-ii/description/)

### Question
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

Example 1
Input: n = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown.

Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
### Approach
Using backtrack, condition to check are not the same rows, cols and pos and neg diagonals
pos diagonal = r+c
neg diagonal = r-c

if condition is met we continue the loop for colums else we add to set of cols and rows and the backtrack the remove it

if r=n we +1 the result

at the end of `backtrack()` we return
