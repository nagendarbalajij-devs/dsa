[N-Queens | Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/description/)

### Question
The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n x n chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. You may return the answer in any order.

Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

Input: n = 4
Output: [[".Q..","...Q","Q...","..Q."],["..Q.","Q...","...Q",".Q.."]]
Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above

### Approach
Using backtrack, condition to check are not the same rows, cols and pos and neg diagonals
pos diagonal = r+c
neg diagonal = r-c

if condition is met we continue the loop for colums else we add to set of cols and rows and the backtrack the remove it

if r=n we appened to the results 

at the end of `backtrack()` we return
